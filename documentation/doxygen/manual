\section intro_sec Introduction
This support module supports eurotherm 2000 series controllers. In order to use this module you should setup the following:

- Default serial settings are 9600 7E1, although you can modify the baud rate. You should setup the serial port / terminal port in this way
- Default device address (cmsAddr) is 01. This translates to GAD=0, LAD=1. For multidrop serial you can change this on the controller to be unique on the bus
- Default protocol is EI-Bisynch. This must be set for this module to work.

The manual for the communication protocol is <a href="../HA026230_3_2000 comms.pdf">here</a>

Manuals for your eurotherm controller are available on <a href=http://www.eurotherm.co.uk/products/controllers/>Eurotherm's website</a>
